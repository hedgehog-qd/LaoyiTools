# LaoyiTools
A tool that connects to my own api, and can download the pictures from that (Made for our interest group)(Just a practice of MFC)

*This is only available for the member in our interest group. Because the picture API is our private API.

*The screenshot is the V1.0 version of this project. In the following versions, we may add the functions such as searching and downloading the files on our internal website and so on. We MAY build an Andriod version.
